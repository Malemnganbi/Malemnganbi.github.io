Today I like to share an short note on "World Environment Day'' 
World Environment Day is the most renowned day for environmental action. Since 1974, it has been celebrated every year on 5 June; engaging governments, businesses, celebrities and citizens to focus their efforts on a pressing environmental issue.First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging from environmental issues to marine pollution, human overpopulation, and global warming, to sustainable consumption and wildlife crime. World Environment Day has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has provided a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and all celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.



World Environment Day 2020: Current Theme, History & Significance

The theme for the World Environment Day 2020 is "Biodiversity". 

According to the UN, it is a concern that is both urgent and existential. Biodiversity supports all life on land and below water or we can say it is the foundation that supports all this. Every aspect of human health is affected by it. It provides clean air, water, food, and is a source of medicines, etc. Human actions like deforestation, encroachment on wildlife habitats, intensified agriculture, and acceleration of global climate change, have disturbed nature and pushed it beyond its limit. According to the UN, it would take 1.6 Earths to meet the demands that humans make of nature every year. If this will continue,  it poses a huge biodiversity loss that will have severe implications for humanity as a result of the loss of food and health systems.

The theme for the World Environment Day 2019 was "Air Pollution".

Air pollution is increasing day by day and it seems complex to control it but nothing is impossible we should come together to combat it. And for this, it is necessary to understand different types of pollution, how it affects our health and environment will help us to steps towards improving the air around us.

We can't stop breathing but we can do something to improve the quality of air that we breathe. Around 92 per cent of the people worldwide do not breathe clean air.

The theme for the World Environment Day 2018 was“Beat Plastic Pollution”.

We know that it is not possible to reuse plastic, they are non-biodegradable. So, it’s better not to use it. Plastics consist of several chemicals which are toxic or disrupt hormones. Plastics can also serve as a magnet for other pollutants, including dioxins, metals and pesticides.

Therefore, it is necessary to call the people from all over the world to come and combat single-use plastic pollution which harms our ecosystem and consequently us.

The slogan is: If you can’t reuse it, refuse it.

World Environment Day: History

Since 1974, World Environment Day has been started celebrating as an annual event on every 5 June to raise the importance of the healthy and green environment in the human lives, to solve the issues of the environment by implementing some positive environmental actions by government, organisations and individual as a whole.

There was a turning point in the year 1972, the development of international environmental politics that is the first major conference on the issues of environment was convened under the United Nations from 5-16 June in Stockholm. It was also known as the Conference on the Human Environment or the Stockholm Conference. Its aim was to commonly look into the challenge of preserving and enhancing the human environment. Then, on 15 December in the same year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution designating 5 June as World Environment Day. Further, another resolution was adopted by the General Assembly on 15 December that led to the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). First time World Environment Day was celebrated in 1974 with the slogan "Only one Earth".
